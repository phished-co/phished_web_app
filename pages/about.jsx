            is a team of students from BCIT studying Digital Design and
            Development and Full-Stack Web Development. With the topic of
            developing online digital solutions for underrepresented or
            disadvantaged communities, our group wanted to address and resolve
            the problem of one of the most common and serious cybercrimes,
            phishing.

            As phishing techniques are constantly evolving, phishing and scam
            campaigns are more common than ever. Elderly individuals are
            targeted more due to their low tech proficiency and typically have
            larger savings.
